	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am curenlty completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Economics student at Virginia Tech.</p>
	<p>I have become enamored with more exotic non-von neumann computer architectures. Specificaly neromophic computing and hardware implementations of spiking neural networks are research areas I want to explore.</p>
	<p>Outside of academics I am heavily involved with the Outdoor Club at Vriginia Tech. I serve as the Trail Maintence Officer to help maintain ~ 30 miles of the Appalachian Trail near Virginia Tech.</p>
